# Project: Bot Assistant (Telegram)

### What the bot can do:
* once every 10 minutes, poll the API of the Practicum.Homework and check the status of the homework sent to the review;
* when updating the status, analyze the API response and send you a corresponding notification in Telegram;
* log its work and inform you about important problems with a Telegram message.
